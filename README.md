**This plugin is currently in an alpha release, currently it is only available on Github for testing purposes, as it is not ready for release yet. It would be really appreciated if you would help me find any bugs by creating an issue in the repository if you find one** 

<h2 align="center">Installation</h2>
To install the plugin, you obviously need to have MelonLoader installed in your game.<br/>
<br/>

When you've done that, simply put `MelonAutoUpdater.dll` to the `Plugins` folder

And now, you're done! Enjoy your mods being automatically updated! ðŸŽ‰

<h2 align="center">Preferences</h2>

| Preference | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Enabled | If true, the plugin will update the mods |
| Ignore List | List of mods (file names without extension example ".dll") that will not be updated |
| Brute Check | If enabled, when there's no download link provided with mod/plugin, it will check every supported platform providing the Name & Author. **WARNING: You may get rate-limited with large amounts of mods/plugins, use with caution** |
| Dont Update | This will cause the plugin to only check for the latest version and notify you if there is a newer version you can install |
| Debug | If true, the plugin will be enabled in Debug mode, providing some possibly useful information |
| Remove Incompatible | If true, if incompatible melons are not updated, they will be removed to avoid possible crashes (for example due to a "Too new" version of .NET) |
| Check Compatibility | If true, melons will be checked to determine if they are compatible with the install, if not, they will not be installed (if those were the download update melons) or removed if the melon was checked, not updated, incompatible and RemoveIncompatible is true<br/>WARNING: This may cause some melons to stop working or the game to crash, due to faulty/incompatible versions |
| Use Pastel | If true, the plugin will use ANSI colors, but might and most likely will make logs hardly readable |

<h2 align="center">Command Line Arguments</h2>

With MelonLoader v0.6.5, now mods & plugins can have their own command line arguments.

Below is a list of all available command line arguments for MelonAutoUpdater:

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--melonautoupdater.disable` | Disables the plugin from executing |
| `--melonautoupdater.debug` | Turns on DEBUG mode |
| `--melonautoupdater.dontupdate` | Disallows the plugin from updating when there's a newer version of a mod available, instead it will just tell you in the console |

<h2 align="center">For Developers</h2>
