Melon Auto Updater is a plugin for MelonLoader that automatically updates all of your mods!<br/>
If a mod has included a download link in the assembly, the updater will pick that up and use that to get the newest version and if needed, install it.<br/>
Currently supported links (this list will be expanded in the near future):<br/>
 - [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io)
 - [Github](https://github.com/)

Tested Games & Versions:
- BONELAB (ML v0.6.4)
- BONEWORKS (ML v0.5.4)

**This plugin is currently in an alpha release, currently it is only available on Github for testing purposes, as it is not ready for release yet. It would be really appreciated if you would help me find any bugs by creating an issue in the repository if you find one** 

<h2 align="center">Installation</h2>
To install the plugin, you obviously need to have MelonLoader installed in your game.<br/>
<br/>

You can use the **MAUHelper Plugin** to determine if u need to install `MAU-net6` or `MAU-net32`, it is also capable of checking if the MelonAutoUpdater is of correct version or not<br/>

If you do not want to use MAUHelper:
  - For MelonLoader v0.6.0 and later, download `MAU-net6.zip` (if there are errors, it is possible that you might need to download `MAU-net32.zip` instead)<br/>
  - For MelonLoader v0.5.7 and earlier, download `MAU-net32.zip`
<br/>

When downloaded, extract the files from the downloaded ZIP and drag the extracted folders into the game.<br/>

And now, you're done! Enjoy your mods being automatically updated! ðŸŽ‰

<h2 align="center">Preferences</h2>

| Preference | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Enabled | If true, the plugin will update the mods |
| Ignore List | List of mods (file names without extension example ".dll") that will not be updated |
| Brute Check | If enabled, when there's no download link provided with mod/plugin, it will check every supported platform providing the Name & Author. **Currently Github is not supported in brute checking due to extremely strict rate limits** |

<h2 align="center">Themes</h2>

Themes are located in UserData/MelonAutoUpdater/themes.cfg, its just a few options that let you customize the color of things such as file names, versions etc. using HEX<br/>
List of all customizable color strings:<br/>
- Lines
- File Names
- Old Version & New Version
- Up-to-date version Text
- Download Count
<br/>
You may ask, why does this option exist, and the answer is.. I'm not sure why I did this, but hey, if u dont like the colors I put in, u can change them!

<h2 align="center">For Developers</h2>

To implement auto-updating into your code mod, simply set a correct **download link** in the [MelonInfo Attribute](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/modders/attributes?id=meloninfo) and please make sure to use the [VerifyLoaderVersion Attribute](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/modders/attributes?id=verifyloaderversion) and specify on what versions of ML does the mod/plugin work
